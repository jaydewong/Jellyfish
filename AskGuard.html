        In your squidizen disguise, the guards don't question your presence. They simply think you're a nosy tourist. They tell you that the doors will open at 10 AM, but the castle is not open to visitors without an appointment. What do you do?
        <ul>
            <li><a href="KingAppointment.html">Leave, and make an appointment with the king.</a></li>
            <li><a href="SnoopAroundTheCastle.html">Say thank you and decide to look around the castle yourself.
            </a></li>
            <li><a href="SneakBehindGuard.html">Leave, and try to sneak behind the guards to get in through the door.</a></li>
            <li><a href="KillGuard.html">Kill the guard.</a></li>
        </ul>
