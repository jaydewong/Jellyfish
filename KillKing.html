        <h2>You pull out your halberd and try to stab the king. The two guards notice this and use their own bodies as shields. But since the guards were wearing ornamental armor, you stab straight through them. As you watch their bodies slide to the ground, more guards rush into the room and arrest you before you are able to escape. You are thrown into jail for murder. </h2>
