        You find a small hidden door that leads inside the castle. It's old and worn, and the wood is cracked. However, this could be your way inside! What do you do?
        <ul> 
            <li><a href="SuccessfulBreakIn.html">Open the door and go inside</a></li>
            <li><a href="SnoopAroundTheCastle.html">Go back</a></li>
           
         </ul>
