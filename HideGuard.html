            You grab the gear weighted guard and the halberd he was carrying and quietly hid the guard underneath the bridge to avoid any unnecessary noise. You try to walk down a hallway, but a guard sees your luminescent skin and identifies you as a jellyfish and an intruder. You are arrested and thrown in jail for trespassing.
