        You go right and find a castle wall that is slightly lower than all the others and seems to be crumbling. This could be your way in! What do you do?
        <ul> 
            <li><a href="SuccessfulBreakIn.html">Climb the wall</a></li>
            <li><a href="BreakWall.html">Bust through the wall</a></li> <!--done, failure-->
           
         </ul>
    </body>
